# A Practical Guide to Bayesian Optimization
This repo is a collection of code associated with the Data Science Nashville meetup held on January 24, 2018: A Practical Guide to Bayesian Optimization. The presentation can be viewed as a powerpoint (**Data_science_nashville_jkk.pptx**) or a pdf (**Data_science_nashville_jkk.pdf**).

- **bayes_opt.yml**: Conda environment necessary to run notebooks.
- **bayes_opt_example.ipynb**: Walkthough of basic Bayesian Optimization technique.
- **gp_example.ipynb**: Visualization of Gaussian process regression in 1D and 2D.
- **gp_kernel.ipynb**: Visualization of different kernels used to fit various target functions.
- **gp_scale.ipynb**: Exploration of scaling issues that can arise when using Gaussian process regression.
- **mercari_modified_utility.py**: Example code showing efficient initialization of Bayesian Optimization object.
- **simple_classification.ipynb**: Example of Bayesian Optimization used on [San Francisco Crime Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime) dataset.
